# Hi welcome
## here is where the fun begins - installing an IDE

So in order to log into a course-specific account on ieng6
first you have to set up your development environment, in which
case, I'm using VSCode. 

You can go ahead and ask jeeves where to find it on the world 
wide web, most likely hosted on the VSCode website 
> thanks microsoft 

steer your way towards installing it and setting it up for use with java by finding the extensions in the sidebar, you'll probably need things like testers for posterity 
> can't escape the tests 

You can access your desired terminal right below by opening up a terminal straight from vscode
